# CSPB3202-Final_Project

This repository contains three notebooks relating to OpenAI Gymnasium: (1) A solution to the CartPole-v1 environment using the PPO algorithm; (2) A solution to the LunarLander-v2 environment again using the PPO algorithm; and (3) A comparison of the PPO, TD3, and SAC algorithms in the context of the LunarLanderContinuous-v2 environment.

Here are the links to my YouTube videos:
